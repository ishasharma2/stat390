Weekly Progress Report: [May 15 to May 19]

Our progress report for this week: 
- Our focus for this week was to continue brainstorming and implementing next steps for our predictive modeling portion of the My Chi My Future project. Our group also discussed some ways of how to predict the number of programs in the next few years, especially focusing on those priority states (for crime reduction) as we mentioned in our project. Our general topic relates to equity metrics and the growth of such equitable programs in Chicago. Because each of our group members are completing the Kaggle Competition alone, we also each made our own independent progress on doing some feature selection and model building for that as well.

Progress/Accomplishments:
- Using the new notebook for the model portion of our project, we committed some changes and preliminary steps for our predictive model.
- discussion of important topics and research questions that we may focus on for our model:
    - Change in number of programs over the next years
    - Predicting accessible programs in the future, especially in the 15 priority community areas
    - How to measure equity?
    - Adding onto our existing slide deck for our presentation next week

Problems/Challenges: Team alignment, Time commitment due to our other courses, balancing MCMF with Kaggle competition
- Unclear on the presentation requirements; would need to contact Professor for more specific details on what to expect for our presentation class

Plan/Next Steps: 
We will each start with building some basic models
- Started adding new slides to our existing slide deck
- Making some changes
We are also all independently planning on making progress on the Kaggle competition

Overall, the team has made good progress this week and will continue to work hard to stay on schedule and ensure the successful completion of the project.
