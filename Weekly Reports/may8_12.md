Weekly Progress Report: [May 8 to May 12]

Our progress report for this week: 
- Our focus for this week was brainstorming next steps for our predictive modeling portion of the My Chi My Future project. Our group also discussed some ways of how to predict the number of programs in the next few years, especially focusing on those priority states (for crime reduction) as we mentioned in our project. Because each of our group members are completing the Kaggle Competition alone, we also each made our own independent progress on doing some feature selection and model building for that as well.

Progress/Accomplishments:
- created a new notebook for the model portion of our project to be more organized and loaded the cleaned data from our eda in.
- discussion of important topics and research questions that we may focus on for our model:
    - Change in number of programs over the next years
    - Accessibility of those programs? Predicting accessible programs in the future, especially in the 15 priority community areas

Problems/Challenges: Team alignment, Time commitment due to our other courses, balancing MCMF with Kaggle competition

Plan/Next Steps: 
We will each start with building some basic models (still brainstorming on which ones to begin with)
- Random forest, linear regression, etc. 
We are also all independently planning on making progress on the Kaggle competition

Overall, the team has made good progress this week and will continue to work hard to stay on schedule and ensure the successful completion of the project.
