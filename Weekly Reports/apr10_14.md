Our progress report for this week: 
- updated readme to align with project goals
- created a data folder with the data that we received from class today inside
- created an Eda notebook and loaded that data in to begin preliminary data exploration
- discussion of important topics and research questions that we may possibly focus on:
    - Most common types of youth programs in Chicago
    - Explore the distribution of different variables in the dataset (e.g., program type, program location, program provider, etc.) using histograms and/or bar charts.
- Next steps: data cleaning
