Problems/Challenges: Time, last minute requirements, unexpected second presentation


Plan/Next Steps: As stated above; slides and selecting from the visualizations we created
- Isha: finalizing the clusters (top 10, least 10) program count
- Grace: finalizing map based on some filters (accessibility, chosen clusters, etc), create new variable that accounts for school-hours
- Dylan: accessibility ('Program Price', 'Program Provides Transportation', 'Capacity', 'start times, end times', 'Program provides free food')

Complete slides by early next week so that we can meet before Friday to allocate presentation time.
Overall, the team has made good progress this week despite encountering some challenges and will continue to work hard to stay on schedule and ensure the successful completion of the project.
